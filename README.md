# AdventOfCode2024
This will store the answers for each day of coding problems from the advent of code Christmas challenge. 

The table below shows the problem day, the amount of time coming up with a solution and the wall time taken for the script to run. Where the code is simple both questions are combined, but when each task gets more complicated I may start splitting it up into a and b. 

*Note that Day 1 time taken also includes setting up the local and remote repository, linking to advent of code and reading the question/coding solution.*
